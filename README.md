💡 Machine Learning 2 Project

- Project Overview 📜

This project is focused on clustering and feature extraction techniques using  machine learning 2 methods unsuperived Learning. The dataset used in this project is people_wiki.csv, which contains textual data for clustering.

🔍 Strucure:
- clustering_module.py             : Implements different clustering algorithms
- evaluation.py                    : Evaluates clustering performance using metrics
- feature_extraction.py            : Vectorized processed text
- main.py                          : Main script i try the modules on different data (trial file)
- notebook_project.ipynb           : Jupyter notebook with code and explanations
- people_wiki.csv                  : Dataset containing textual data
- preprocessing.py                 : Preprocessing steps for data cleaning
- visualization.py                 : Generates visualizations of clustering results
- requirements.txt                 : all dependencies
